Working with Polymorphism

Make a program to read data from N products (N supplied by the user). At end, show the price tag of each product in the
same order in which they were typed.\
Every product has a name and price. Products imported have a customs fee, and Used products have a date of manufacture.
These specific data must be added to the price tag as per example (see below). For products imported, the tax and customs must be added to the final price of the product.

`The program must work like this:`

Enter the number of products: 3\
Product #1 data:\
